# Text summarization using BERT,Latent Semantic Analysis LSA,LexRank and T5 Transformers
LexRank selects sentences with the highest centrality scores, indicating their importance and similarity to other sentences in the text. It assumes that sentences with higher similarity to other sentences are more likely to be important and thus included in the summary
LSA identifies the most significant sentences by considering their contribution to the underlying latent topics. Sentences with high weights on important topics are selected for the summary
 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) are transformer-based models pre-trained on large corpora of text data. BERT uses a masked language model (MLM) objective to learn bidirectional representations of text, while T5 uses a text-to-text framework where both inputs and outputs are text sequences. BERT and T5 are capable of both extractive and abstractive summarization. For extractive summarization, they can rank sentences based on their representation embeddings or predict the probability of each sentence being included in the summary. For abstractive summarization, they generate summaries by conditioning on the input text and generating new text tokens.
In summary, LexRank, LSA, and TextRank are traditional algorithms based on graph-based methods and linear algebra techniques, while BERT and T5 are state-of-the-art transformer models capable of extractive and abstractive summarization using deep learning techniques. The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the size and nature of the text data, the desired type of summary (extractive or abstractive), and the available computational resources.
